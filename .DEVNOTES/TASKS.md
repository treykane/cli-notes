# Tasks

- [ ] Add mouse-driven editor selection using Bubble Tea mouse events and map drag gestures to the shared selection API.
- [ ] Add Undo/Redo support in edit mode (keyboard shortcuts + predictable history boundaries for format toggles, typing bursts, and save).
- [ ] Add multiline visual selection highlighting in edit mode (currently text-only highlight is limited to single-line selections).
